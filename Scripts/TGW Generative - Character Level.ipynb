       "'We pick up where we left off, which means we have to experience the heartbreak all over again.\\xa0 I really wanted that. Kalinda tries to call Alicia to tell her first, but she can’t make the words come out of her mouth. Alicia can tell that something’s wrong, but poor Kalinda, who loves Alicia so much and would never want to hurt her, doesn’t know how to say what’s on her mind. It would be a difficult situation for anyone to be in; it’s a thousand times more difficult for someone with Kalinda’s personality. I don’t know why, but I remember this case a lot more clearly than most cases on this show. I think it’s the song (Thicky Trick was not TGW’s first earworm!). Marissa’s back! Love her! “America does not suck. People suck,” proclaims Eli. I love the way Eli and Marissa talk. Eli tells Diane she should consider (again) running for a judgeship. During s4/s5, I remembered very clearly that Diane had been approached to run for a judgeship, but I didn’t remember that Eli also brought the subject up with her. Kalinda asks Alicia if she’s happy, and I initially misinterpreted this scene as Kalinda trying to make Alicia think about her life as much as possible before everything falls apart (as she does when she pushes Will closer to Alicia later), but Syb and Kiki corrected me: at this point, the only way the information makes its way to Alicia is if Kalinda tells her, so Kalinda’s just seeing if she should tell her now or let her be blissfully unaware. Alicia’s answer: “It’s like when a storm is over: is it happiness, or just relief?” Even before everything falls apart, Alicia’s doubting her happiness. She’s not sure what she wants, and she’s not sure that’s she’s unhappy, but she’s aware that she’s questioning her life. The case of the week involves a really creepy murderer (serial killer?) who for some reason latches onto Alicia. I don’t know why she attracts creepy men so often (a lot of them seem to like the “devoted wife” thing), but she does. Sorry, Alicia. The Kalinda/Peter scene at the Florrick campaign HQ is difficult to watch. I feel for Peter (who probably doesn’t know that Kalinda and Alicia are such good friends), who doesn’t want to mess things up again and hurt someone he loves, but I have trouble feeling sorry for him when he says, “I’ve fallen in love with my wife again.” Good for you, I guess, but loving her now doesn’t make the past meaningless. That shouldn’t be the reason Alicia doesn’t get to know this information. If you’re going to keep it from Alicia—which you shouldn’t have done in the first place, Peter—then it needs to be for her sake. Diane’s working on an immigration case for Eli/Natalie and needs to jump the line in a court she doesn’t frequent (too low-level for her). She jumps the line, and the second she says she’s Diane Lockhart, the judge stops everything to help her. Always fun to see the characters in the larger world, whether it’s an article about Will, a video about Peter, a client recognizing Alicia, or something like this. I do not like the opposing counsel. She’s annoying and obnoxious. The case of the week is a civil case that’s right on the heels of a criminal case Cary was handling, so Cary is working with the L/G team. One of my favorite uses of the Cary at the SA’s office arc. Marissa tells Eli that Vanessa (not mentioned here by name) has observed that at the end of every campaign, Eli develops a crush and tries to distract himself from the fact that he’s doing bad things by latching on to one cause. I’d believe this as a trend, but we didn’t see anything of the sort in season 4. Zach and Grace are playing a game at the kitchen counter and quoting some YouTube video I’d never seen until I watched Zach and Grace quoting it. Alicia says she doesn’t understand the reference—I’m with ya, Alicia. The Florrick family sits down for dinner, chatting about the future and possibly moving to a new house or a new apartment, and the episode ends with Alicia saying to Zach, “You already took two slices [of pizza], dude!” in a voice that sounds unlike Alicia and like something you’d say to a five year old, not a 15 year old. My guess is that the actors were asked to ad lib some dinner table conversation (rare for this show, where the actors follow the scripts word for word, but common on shows like Parenthood) and Julianna wound up talking to her TV son the way she talks to her (much younger) real life son.'"

       "'The elevator doors open on the LAL\\nreception desk. “Welcome to Lockhart, Agos, and Lee,” Diane narrates. “As you\\nprobably know, we are an all-service law firm with a rich tradition. The firm\\nwas formed twelve years ago by Jonas Stern, and myself, Diane Lockhart.” Only\\ntwelve years ago? Formed by Stern and Diane, but not Will? Continuity errors\\nabound. Or maybe not—Stern/Diane founding and Will joining later was the\\nnarrative up until season five. Whatever. Diane is looking for a narrative\\nhere, not accuracy. (Also, LOL at that portrait of Stern.) “Last year, the firm reconstituted\\nitself with Cary Agos and David Lee as name partners,” Diane says, omitting the\\npart where… well, the entire series happens. I presume you’ve watched it, so I\\nwon’t recap it. “We occupy two floors in the\\nDryden building: the executive suite on the 28th floor and the 27th\\nfloor, where support staff and most associates work,” Diane explains. Hey!\\nStock footage! It’s like the good old days! Also, the Dryden building is not\\nexist, and the building they’ve used to show the firm since season one is\\nactually the Jeweler’s Building. “As a new associate, you will be\\ngiven a card key for your assigned floor, and you will be provided an employee\\nhandbook. Due to severe overcrowding, not all of you will receive an office.\\nSome of you may have to work from cubicles for the moment.” Ah. So this is\\norientation day for a new crop of associates. We cut to the room where Diane’s\\nspeaking after all of this exposition and re-establishing. “Lockhart, Agos, and\\nLee is a true meritocracy,” she begins to conclude her remarks, making me laugh\\nuncontrollably. Yes. If there’s one thing we’ve seen over the years it’s\\nDEFINITELY that LAL/LG/whatever the fuck it is/was/will be is a true meritocracy. “One of our name partners\\ncame from where you sit now in a mere six years. It can be done, and we expect\\nno less of you,” Diane explains. BWAH! Cary Agos, straight white rich boy,\\nPOSTER CHILD FOR TRUE MERITOCRACY. And not only that, but Cary’s rise has been\\nanything but meritocratic. That’s not to say he doesn’t deserve to be name\\npartner, but this is the firm that fired him (twice) and once offered him a\\npartnership because they were starved for money and his buy-in would give them\\nquick cash. It’s the firm he left because he felt they weren’t valuing him based on merit, and a firm he’s only a name\\npartner of now because he tied himself to Alicia, who is herself valuable\\nbecause she tied herself to Peter. Lockhart, Agos, and Lee: A True Meritocracy. (Yes, I know this is all a sales\\npitch—the glossing over of struggle, the use of the word “reconstituted” to\\ndescribe something a lot more complicated that involved becoming another firm\\novernight. It’s still totally inaccurate, even if it’s exactly what Diane needs\\nto be saying in this situation.) The camera pans around the room to\\nreveal that… Lucca—a very uncomfortable Lucca, aware that she’s being talked\\ndown to—is one of these new associates. Notably, Alicia is not. Alicia is… on an elevator headed\\nstraight to the 28th. Lucca meets her there. “Well, look at you,\\nbig-time lawyer,” Alicia greets her. “Well, look at you, coming back home,”\\nLucca replies. Home. It does look right to see Alicia in this space, but is it\\nreally home for her? We’ll see. (“You Can’t Go Home Again” was the title of\\n1x03 before they decided to make all the titles one word. Can you go home again\\nnow?) “Yep. Not much has changed,”\\nAlicia sighs. She’s not excited to be back. “Did we make a mistake?” Lucca\\nwonders. “I don’t know. We’ll see,” Alicia replies. Cary walks in. “Hey, Alicia,” he\\ngreets Alicia, arms literally outstretched. They hug. “God, this is really\\nweird,” Alicia frets. “I know, but not bad weird, is it?” Cary asks. “Not yet,”\\nAlicia replies. She’s been there thirty seconds and she’s having doubts. Cary tells Alicia there’s no room\\nfor her on the 28th—Alicia already knew that—and that she’s getting\\nthe biggest office on the 27th. “Hey, it’s where I started out,”\\nAlicia accepts. Lucca is constantly in the frame during this exchange, but\\nshe’s silent, neither speaking nor being spoken to. If it wasn’t already\\nobvious, she’s only there because the firm’s doing Alicia a favor. They don’t\\ncare about Lucca. “It’s where we started out,” Cary\\nreminds Alicia, and aaaaaaaahhhhhh season 1!!!! I miss season one. One of the\\nthings I like most about season one, on rewatch, is how well-built the world of\\nthe firm feels because there’s a clear hierarchy in place. Rather than\\nupsetting everything at the partner level (which they also do), the writers can\\nfind a lot of drama in the relationships between the characters who have power\\nand the characters who have no power. Alicia and Cary have to compete while\\ndeferring to Diane and Will and Stern, but also to more senior associates and\\npartners. In the later seasons, everyone becomes (at least in theory) everyone\\nelse’s equal, which means it’s harder to draw out tensions organically. \\xa0Now we seem to be returning to a world where\\nthe characters are spread out: Diane and Cary are name partners, Alicia is a\\njunior partner who doesn’t have as much status as she used to, and Lucca is a\\nfirst year associate. As Alicia and Cary (and Lucca)\\nwalk to the 27th floor, Lucca whispers to Alicia, “And I’m on the 27th\\ntoo, so we can pass notes.” Hehe. Lucca continues to follow Alicia\\nand Cary to Alicia’s office. Lucca gets a cubicle. Alicia gets an office\\n(Finn’s office? Her season one office? They’ve redone the 27th floor\\nset since season one so it’s hard to get my bearings) and a bottle of champagne\\nwaiting for her. Again, Lucca stays in the frame throughout this scene, in\\nfocus as Cary presents Alicia with her new office, stresses their shared\\nhistory, presents her with a gift from the partners, and asks Alicia to grab lunch with him. Cary doesn’t totally ignore Lucca,\\nthough. He makes sure to tell her about how she needs to meet Monica at some\\npoint. Monica, whom she’s already met. Multiple times. All while Cary was\\npresent. Monica, whom Cary assumes Lucca will just adore because they’re both\\nblack. “We’ve already met,” Lucca\\nclarifies. “Oh, oh, right, yeah, on the ChumHum case. Well, you’ll love her,”\\nCary stumbles. Lucca knows what’s going on. “Shall we drink that now?” she asks\\nAlicia the second Cary’s out of the room. Alicia laughs and sits down in her\\nchair… which promptly breaks. Hey, where have I seen that before? http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyydxkwbrq1qzkueso1_500.gif “Yeah, I’d hire you,” Lucca jokes.\\nThen Howell—you know, the IT guy that taught Kalinda how to fake\\nmetadata?—bursts in and says, for real, “Alicia! I think I need to hire you.”\\nHeh. She greets Howell and introduces Lucca. Tech case time! Important points:\\nHowell has an unreleased ChumHum tablet (his girlfriend found it) that tech\\nblogs want to buy from him, Lucca knows something about tech, and Alicia knows\\nnothing about tech. Lucca hears $100,000 and jumps on\\nthe case. If this were Florrick/Quinn, sure! But this is Lockhart/Agos/Lee, and\\nAlicia’s back to her usual considerate self after last week’s I’m Going To Sue\\nA Sitting Judge What Could Possibly Go Wrong fiasco. She stops Lucca to consult\\nfor a moment, and says “This could be sticky.” Cut to a juice bar, where Marissa\\nis working, serving a juice drink called a Selfie. Marissa must hate this\\nplace. A cute young guy walks up to\\norder, and begins to flirt with Marissa. He asks her out. This would be so cute\\nif he weren’t an FBI agent (the one from 7x03!) trying to bring down Peter. “It’s so good to have you back,”\\nDiane welcomes Alicia with a hug. “Home is where they take you in, right?”\\nAlicia responds. “Happily take you in,” Diane adds. Alicia then introduces\\nLucca, who Diane says she remembers from earlier this morning (not several\\ntimes they’ve met in court?). Diane also says she has to introduce Lucca to\\nMonica, and Lucca politely reminds Diane that she has already met Monica, on\\nthe Chummie Maps case. Case talk happens, and more\\ninteresting than the case talk is that everything Lucca says gets dismissed\\npatronizingly by the partners because it’s coming from Lucca. Cary and Diane don’t want to risk\\na lawsuit over a favor to an employee—which makes a lot of sense to me–, but\\nLucca gets a plan in motion, calling to try to “return” the tablet so Howell is\\ncovered under the law. I don’t hate Alicia’s wig as much\\nin this episode. It looks more like actual hair, and that’s good. “So this is bureaucracy,” Lucca\\nsays as Cary and Diane discuss whether or not to take the case. Alicia rolls\\nher eyes. This case quickly becomes representative of the difference in power\\nbetween the partners and Alicia (and Lucca, but Lucca has no power at all). The Marissa/agent convo is fun and\\nhas a lot of good background on Marissa, but doesn’t contain much worth\\ntranscribing (even though it’s very worth watching). Hlavin or whatever his\\nname is begins to ask questions about Eli the second he gets a chance. Marissa\\ncatches on fast. “You are a curious one, aren’t you?” She begins to record the\\nconversation. Smart. As soon as she gets off work,\\nMarissa heads to Eli’s office to tell him what’s happened. Eli wants to know\\nwhat he looks like, and Marissa covered that, too—she convinced him to take a\\nselfie with her. I am in awe, Marissa. Eli sees him and recognizes him\\nright away: he’s Roland Hlavin. Eli wants details on the conversation, and\\nMarissa, understanding that she doesn’t have her father’s gift for remembering\\nexact conversations years (or even hours) later, begins to play the audio\\nrecording. Eli takes a moment to stop\\npanicking and be proud of his daughter. “What?” Marissa asks. “It’s just… now I\\nget why people have children. They can admire themselves in someone else,” Eli\\nresponds. BWAH! Sparky is waiting outside of\\nAlicia’s office, with a grin on his face, when she returns. She shows him\\naround her new office, including the broken chair. “I like it. It fits you,” Jason\\ncomments. “Off-center?” Alicia asks. “Tilted,” he responds. She laughs. Is this\\nan acknowledgment that she’s still not centered and is still struggling?\\nCertainly, she’s still struggling with the fallout of the disastrous career\\nmove she made last week and she’s off-balance at LAL, but might it extend\\nbeyond that?\\xa0 Then they have a really happy\\nflirty conversation about Jason’s beard. Okay. I like seeing smiling silly\\nAlicia, so, okay. “We kissed,” Alicia says\\nstraightforwardly. “I know,” Jason replies.” “So what do we do now?” Alicia\\nasks. “I don’t know. I’m not big on planning,” Jason says. RUN, ALICIA, RUN!\\nRun away from all things unplanned because I’m getting really sick of writing\\nabout the necessity of plans! No, but really, I’m fine with\\nthis. They do need to have plans, but it doesn’t need to be that serious yet,\\nand there’s less planning required here than there would’ve been with Will in\\n1x23 (and she’s not talking about leaving Peter for Jason, at least not yet)\\n(and her kids are both basically out of the house, not in middle school). I’m\\napprehensive about anyone around Alicia suggesting that plans don’t matter, but\\nnot to the point where I’m going to read a lot into what’s really just flirty\\nbanter putting the ball in Alicia’s court. Plus, it seems pretty clear they\\nboth intend to continue this, since the next place the conversation goes is to\\nthe ethics/awkwardness of a workplace romance in a corporate environment. It’s almost sickening how\\nsaccharine this scene is. So flirty. God. They just keep smiling at each other\\nlike teenagers. No way that kind of happiness—giddiness is probably closer to\\nthe right word, actually—lasts, but it must be pretty enjoyable in the moment. ALICIA IN GLASSES ALERT! Cary wants to drop the Howell\\ncase, and now Alicia feels the need to confront him about this because Howell\\nis an employee. Well. That’s not really why. Mostly because this stopped being\\nabout Howell and started being about LAL’s values a while ago. There’s a\\ncertain pattern they follow where their business interests will take precedence\\nover helping employees, and Alicia doesn’t like it one bit. She’s currently receiving good treatment, but\\nshe knows how it works all too well. They have to take the case now,\\nanyway, because Howell is being arrested by some police force none of the LAL\\nlawyers have ever heard of. And… title credits! As shaky as Alicia’s return to LAL\\nis (both on a character level and on a meta level), it is really lovely to see Alicia, Diane, and Cary working together\\nagain. It’s been a while. And even if Alicia’s journey may take her away from\\nDiane and Cary, the show as a whole does tend to work better when all/most of\\nits regulars are in the same place. Neil Gross himself shows up in the\\ndirty interrogation room. That’s weird. He is still an asshole. There are so\\nmany assholes in this episode. Gross wants to know who gave Howell the\\nprototype, and then everything will be fine (for Howell). Basically, this weird\\ndivision of the police seems to be in ChumHum’s pocket, and Cary et al are\\nsuspicious. Speaking of assholes, the next\\nperson we see is Schakowsky. I don’t dislike him as a character, but he enrages\\nme. Breathe in. Breathe out. It’s a short scene, anyway. Eli is\\ntracking down anyone who could potentially be a problem for Peter, and\\nSchakowsky is his first stop because of the past connection to Hlavin and the\\nbribery thing Eli tipped him off about. Apparently, Hlavin is asking about\\nAlicia. Uh oh. Court stuff happens. Lucca’s\\ncalled off the case by Diane. This judge feels so season one. I\\nlove it. So much quirk. This wouldn’t work for me, except that it makes me\\nnostalgic, and that works for me very well at this point in time (eight\\nepisodes left!). (He’s not a season one judge. He is, however, a season three\\njudge.) Alicia keeps taking her glasses on\\nand off and on and off and on and off. That must be so frustrating. Can we get\\na subplot about Alicia’s vision and why she started to wear glasses in season\\nsix, and why she wears them all the time now? At the office, Diane informs Lucca\\nshe needs her on the Dipple filing. Ouch. Grunt work. At least it’s grunt work\\nfor a top client? (“The Dipple filing” is the new “Sheffron-Marks” or\\n“Murphy-Gomez” only it seems even less substantial than those projects ever\\ndid.) Diane and Cary insist that Lucca prioritize the Dipple filing over the\\nHowell defense. Whether this is because they’re trying to prove a point (to\\nLucca or to Alicia) about firm dynamics or because they need another hand on\\nthe filing is unclear. Both, perhaps? “You can work with Monica,” Diane\\nexplains. “You’ll love working with her,” Cary adds, again. MONICA remembers Lucca right away.\\n“So. I’m supposed to really like you,” Monica says the second the white people\\nleave. “Yes. Let’s share about our common experiences,” Lucca responds. Court stuff happens. “Foundation. Sure. That’s an\\nobjection. Overruled.” I kinda love this judge. Eli tracks down Marissa at work.\\nShe says Hlavin didn’t say anything of note about Alicia, but that she’s\\nwilling to go on a “date” with him to find out more and/or protect Alicia. The opening of the next act is a\\nvisual I love deeply: Eli reclining on Alicia’s couch. Season one <3 As soon as I saw a couch in\\nAlicia’s office, I thought, “I hope we get a scene of Eli sitting on it.” I\\ndidn’t think they’d actually give us a shot of Eli stretched out on it. Awwwww!\\nI’m happy. “So. The 27th floor\\nagain. Everything comes full circle, doesn’t it?” Eli comments. “Yes. First the\\ntragedy, then the farce,” Alicia adds. That seems like a highly appropriate\\ncomment for more than just Alicia being back on the 27th floor. Eli makes sure they’re on good\\nterms (they are). “I think the feds are investigating you,” he informs Alicia\\njust as her chair tilts again. Huh. Could that maybe be symbolic or something?\\nAlicia’s in a precarious position? Hmmm. HMMMMMMMMMMM. “Oh God, it never ends,” Alicia\\ncomments. I think she’s even said this line before (I want to say right after\\nshe won SA). Hell, she’s probably said it several times before. Also neverending is the parade of\\nassholes in this episode. Mr. Asshole Genius, who you may remember from 7x07,\\nis back, to be an asshole genius going head to head with another asshole genius. For being a former partner at LG,\\nEli gets pretty offended when Asshole Genius mistakes him for a lawyer. I’ve\\nalways wondered if Eli has a law degree. I don’t think he does, but it might\\nmake sense for him to. Asshole Genius is not okay with\\nLAL having cases other than the one he is involved with. But since making\\nAsshole Genius happy also means getting to work with/fight for Lucca, Alicia’s\\ncool with Lucca staying. Court stuff happens. Did you know\\nLucca got her name because her parents travel a lot? Guess who’s back? Ruth Eastman!!!\\nDidn’t realize (until I read the press release) that we’d be seeing her again!\\nShe’s sitting behind Eli’s desk, waiting for him. Before she explains why she’s\\nthere, she comments on the painting Courtney gave Eli. She doesn’t like it—all\\nthe people look like they want something and that makes her nervous. Anyway,\\nshe’s worried Eli’s out to get her because she just received a grand jury\\nsubpoena from the FBI. Yet another ham sandwich? YAHS to make it one word? Eli had nothing to do with this\\nsubpoena, and reassures Ruth it’s just standard procedure (they both know it’s\\nnot) while internally freaking the fuck out. The second Ruth leaves, Eli calls\\nMarissa and asks her to ask Hlavin out on another date. Yikes. Cary finds Monica working on the\\nDipple filing alone. Lucca shows up just in time, but there are agents with a\\nsearch warrant in the office now, and that’s more important than if Lucca is\\ndoing paperwork or not. The agents are looking for the ChumHum tablet… which\\nthey won’t find, because Lucca has it. Okay. Nelson McCormick, the\\ndirector of this episode, is doing a much better job here than he did in 6x21\\n(dude: your ability to make things look cool is not as important as telling the\\nstory well and in keeping with the aesthetic of the show), but why the hell is\\nthis sequence shot with a handheld camera? Distracting and unnecessary. (Maybe\\nthis is a cinematography thing—I’m never quite sure where to draw the line—but\\nit seems like a rare thing to happen on TGW so I blame the director.) Back from break, Diane is\\nlecturing Lucca about how she failed to follow orders. Lucca sits on a couch.\\nDiane and Cary tower over her. Alicia stands in the background. See? http://images.springfieldspringfield.co.uk/screencaps/the-good-wife-2009/season7/s07e14/s07e14_438.jpg\\nPower dynamics. Diane pulls Alicia aside to talk.\\n“So. We have to find a working rhythm here again,” Diane opens once they’re\\nseated in her office. “I know. The Howell case got a bit out of hand,” Alicia\\nresponds. “No, it’s bigger than that,” Diane adds. “Okay,” Alicia says. “When Cary suggested that you come\\nback, I wasn’t against it, but I was afraid that there might be a few bumps,”\\nDiane explains. “Which bumps might those be?” Alicia inquires where she once\\nmight’ve apologized. “A certain independence and a resistance to\\noversight,” Diane lists. This is accurate—and it’s not unreasonable of Diane to\\nexpect that her employee (former partner and FLOIL or not) to not resist her\\nauthority. “Okay. Tell me how you would like\\nme to improve,” Alicia says. She’s got her interview voice on… “Lucca isn’t your associate. She\\nis the firm’s associate,” Diane states. “I understand. She caught the Howell\\ncase with me, so I thought the associate that caught the case stays with the\\ncase,” Alicia defends herself. “Sometimes. If the partners agree,” Diane says,\\nplaying rank. (McCormick, you don’t need to shoot this at a high angle.\\nShot-reverse-shot will suffice.) Alicia apologizes and asks if Diane has\\nanything else. She does: “Lucca needs to know\\nthat she is answerable to the firm, and not just to you.” Alicia’s been shying\\naway from actually picking a fight, being polite yet pointed and accepting\\nDiane’s criticisms, but here, she starts to push back. “And that’s why you have\\nher on the Dipple case?” Alicia asks. Diane says it’s just because they\\nneeded someone on the Dipple case. Yeah. Sure. “Diane. I’m thrilled to be back. I\\nwant to be of service. But I also returned with some cases, clients, and\\nknowledge,” Alicia tries to spin. Diane pushes back. “You mean in bond court?” Even though Diane’s mocking her,\\nAlicia refuses to let the insult land. “Yes. I do mean in bond court. Lucca is\\ngood. She’s smart and forward leaning and a prodigy. And, with respect, she\\nshouldn’t be given grunt work.” Yay! And by yay, I mean, “I’m glad that Alicia\\nis defending her new friend when it would be much easier for her to lay low and\\nstay out of trouble!” Also: 7x01 was originally titled Grunts, because (as Canning says), the\\nwork of a bar attorney is grunt work. Alicia had a learning curve to figure out\\nhow to deal with the grunt work of Lucca’s world, and now Lucca, in Alicia’s\\nworld, has to learn how to deal with this other form of grunt work. Alicia had\\nLucca to help her out, and now Lucca has Alicia to do as much as she can. 7x01\\nhinted, a bit, at the fact that Lucca is smart and capable but might be out of\\nher element doing work outside of bond court, and 7x14 picks up that thread.\\n(We’ve seen Lucca shift to dealing with cases more like the ones LAL takes on;\\nnow she has to learn the corporate structure.) “Your advice is welcome. The\\npartners will consider it. Thank you,” Diane brushes Alicia off. (This is one\\nof those, “I plan to decide in the next 48 hours…” statements.) “Anything else?” Alicia probes.\\n“No, you can go,” Diane dismisses her. Alicia nods. Not only was that the most\\nhostile friendly meeting ever (so many “fuck you”s left unsaid!), but Diane\\nslipped up (or did she?) at the end, dismissing Alicia the way she would\\ndismiss a low level staffer. “You can go,” suggests that Alicia would be unable\\nto leave the meeting without Diane’s approval. “No, that’s all for now,”\\nwould’ve ended the meeting, too. Alicia has other things to do; she didn’t need\\nto be given permission to leave. But Diane gave her permission to leave, and\\nAlicia recognized that underneath all the pleasantries, Diane is trying to\\nprove a point: she outranks her. This is not a bad point for Diane\\nto want to prove! Alicia is not a name partner and she’s lucky they took her back in. She holds some status, but not much,\\nand Diane needs to set precedents upfront if she wants to be able to manage the\\nfirm. I totally support Diane in making it clear where things stand with her firm. I may not approve of her (and\\nCary’s) methods (giving Lucca grunt work to prove a point? Sigh), but she, not\\nAlicia, is the boss. I feel for Alicia, trying to stick up for a friend and not\\nappreciating having her experiences trivialized, but… Diane is still the boss.\\nIf Alicia doesn’t want to deal with that, then she shouldn’t have agreed to\\ncome back, or she should leave the second she’s back on her feet. Court stuff happens. How am I\\ngoing to pretend to understand the tech world when this show ends?! I’ve gotten\\nby in so many conversations because of these cases. I knew what bitcoin was\\nbefore it was cool, and I bet you all did, too. (Confession: I still don’t\\nquite get bitcoin beyond what Zach and Nisa explained about it in 3x13.) Aaaaand… breathe. When Eli asked\\nMarissa to set up another date, I was worried that this would lead to some\\n“funny” plotline where a father asks his daughter to seduce a man to get\\ninformation. Nah. Eli just wants a place and time to find Hlavin so he can talk\\nto him. Phew. We still don’t know what this\\nanti-Florrick mess is about. Engaging. Here’s hoping it’s something with only a\\nmoderate amount of plot holes! Alicia and Jason talk about case\\nstuff. Jason mentions that a tech site wants to buy the ChumHum tablet for more\\nthan they originally offered, so… Alicia runs to Lucca’s cubicle. “Please tell\\nme you haven’t been negotiating with Gadgy,” Alicia starts. Lucca’s a little\\noffended Alicia thinks she’s been negotiating, so Alicia explains: “You’ve been\\nhell-bent on proving Cary and Diane wrong. You can’t dig in on principle at a\\nfirm like this.” You can’t when you’re on your own and barely getting by\\neither, right, Alicia? Isn’t that why you ended up back here? (Also, I feel\\nlike Alicia dug in on principle all the time at SLG? Not intentionally spiteful\\nstuff to prove a point like this would be, but changing strategies and taking\\non pet cases and stuff.) “I know that coming here wasn’t\\nyour first choice, believe me, it wasn’t mine, but our hand was forced,” Alicia\\nadvises. Damn, after 7x12’s final scene, I assumed Lucca had been on board with\\ncoming to LAL in some capacity (maybe not the associate part). I would’ve loved\\nto have seen the Alicia/Lucca conversation where they made this decision. Back to the case! Howell was\\ntweeting! And now they have a strategy! Eli can now tell Ruth the target\\nis Peter, not her. Eli doesn’t know what the issue will be. Ruth tells him that\\nit’s whatever one they never kept files on. I wonder what it could be. No,\\nreally—I have no idea if there’s an unresolved thread, if they’re going to\\nretcon something, if there’s something that could be taken out of context, or\\nif they’re (either the government or the writers) going to invent something\\nwe’ve never heard of. At least Eli and Ruth are on good\\nterms now! Court stuff happens! Howell is\\nfree! Cary tells Lucca the Howell case\\nwent well, and now he needs her on something else. Lucca saved the day and now\\ngets to be an honorary partner, right!? Of course not. She’s back to doing\\npaperwork with Monica. The hierarchy of the firm is here to stay, regardless of\\nthe outcome of one case. “Do you know any spirituals?”\\nMonica says to Lucca, who laughs. Hehe. Ruth is waiting in Alicia’s office\\nnow. She doesn’t sit down behind her\\ndesk, the way she did with Eli. Instead, she stands and waits, a bottle of\\ntequila in hand. (Maybe she did try to sit at the desk, then encountered the\\nBroken Chair Of Comedy and Symbolism!) Alicia is happy to see Ruth, and also\\nhappy to see the tequila, which she opens. “Rough day?” Ruth asks. “It was a\\nbumpy reentry,” Alicia explains. “Yes, I was surprised. I thought you reveled\\nin your independence,” Ruth remarks. “Big decisions are easy when you have no\\nother options,” Alicia states. True. True, true, true. Whatever type of tequila Ruth\\nbrought is strong by Alicia’s standards.\\nWoah. Ruth warns Alicia about the target\\non Peter’s back. “No question Peter loves you, but he can hurt you. Drag you\\ndown. Not only destroy everything you’ve done, but everything you want to do.\\nCash out while you still can.” Huh. I was wondering when Alicia’s marriage was\\ngoing to come back into play, since it’s one of the remaining things in her\\nlife she needs to address. Big decisions are easy when you have no other\\noptions, Alicia says. Does she have other options here? Will she feel a desire\\nto stay married to Peter through this ordeal because she cares enough about him\\nnot to leave him right before a grand jury? Will she want to stay married through\\nthe duration of the grand jury in case it turns on her or in case she’s forced\\nto turn on Peter—both things which, if I understand spousal privilege\\ncorrectly, would be much less likely with the marriage still intact? Or will\\nshe see this as her moment to get out once and for all? I really can’t say, but\\nAlicia does seem to be taking Ruth’s words to heart. Ruth leaves. The chair tilts again\\nbecause ALICIA IS OFF-CENTER! IN EVERY ELEMENT OF HER LIFE!! This news is UNSETTLING!!! And SHIFTS HER\\nWORLD!!! (I don’t mind this chair thing too much, but oy, this show and\\nsymbolism…) The camera pulls back to show\\nAlicia, in her office, slowly drinking tequila, surrounded by the commotion and\\nexpanse of LAL. The angle’s a little different here, but I’m choosing to read\\nthis as a reference to the last shot of Pilot. (In her other offices, Alicia has\\nspun around on chairs to appreciate her space. Here, her chair is broken.)'"

The kids are extremely important, as we’ll see demonstrated very clearly later in this scene, to both Peter and Alicia. Beyond that, their decisions affect their children. So the writers start this episode by reaffirming the importance of the family unit to both Alicia and Peter and by insisting that the viewer consider another dimension of the fight.

Alicia’s evaluations are mixed. Her peers think she’s professional and diligent, but find her stand-offish and think she keeps “leisurely hours.” None of that surprises me: Alicia is a very closed off person who’s probably more interested in working at work than chatting and won’t be the one to start (or continue, even) a conversation unless it’s about work.

      "This is the first episode directed by Robert King, and it shows. RK likes momentum—the camera and the characters are almost always in motion; what’s in the frame constantly changes (he also loves directing episodes where the characters are under a time crunch). The blocking of the opening scene has Will walk around the courtroom, the power of his closing arguments radiating through the television screen. Robert King’s directing interests me a lot not because he’s the best director working on the show (my untrained eye loves his episodes, though) but because when we see an episode he writes and directs, we’re getting as close as we can to seeing the show as he (and Michelle, but Robert is the one who does more of the writing) intends it to be seen. Not only does he get to coax the performances he wants out of the actors, the show looks different. It’s a bit more sleek and dynamic when Robert King directs rather than subtlely beautiful. Robert King’s frame compositions tend to be more striking than most of TGW’s directors (the best way I have of articulating what I mean is that it would be easier to put together a picspam of pretty screencaps from a RK episode than from any random episode), too.\n"

      "One of my biggest criticisms of the criticism that TGW gets is the argument that the title should be different because Alicia’s not literally “Good”. People love to point this out like they’ve noticed a huge discord between the show’s intentions and what makes it to the screen, when really, what they’ve noticed is the point of the show. They somehow haven’t figured out that the title is meant to be ironic and call out unrealistic societal expectations.  Anyway, I’m complaining about this now because the show does itself no favors on this subject by opening season three with “Baby Did a Bad, Bad Thing.” One of the rare song choices I don’t like on this show.\n",

And, in one of the rare moments where I actually agree with Jackie, Jackie notes that she did offer to help Alicia, but “every time, you said, ‘I want to do it on my own.’” Correct. We know that’s correct because this isn’t the first or the last time Jackie’s offered to help Alicia financially.  And while it’s noble that Alicia wants to do this on her own, and certainly very important for her to remember how to be independent, she can’t have it both ways: she can’t blame Jackie for contributing to her struggle while refusing to let Jackie help when she offers to.\n",

      "Uh oh. Five of the worst words in the English language are, “Previously on The Good Wife,” and I don’t take kindly to hearing them. Especially not when they’re in a recap of the last episode’s case, of all things, on a show that expects us to be able to recall minor characters and plot points from five seasons ago.  While I’m on that subject, last week’s case was awful. The case itself was fine—ripped from the headlines, but fine—but it was integrated into the episode poorly. TGW does three types of episodes: Episodes with cases that are important and hold things together, episodes without cases or where the COTW only exists to show that everyone’s still working, and episodes where the case is a gimmick the writers push so far it ends up being inconsequential and boring to watch. Shiny Objects’ case had the potential to be in the first category, but was written so poorly that it’s solidly in the third category. And it’s a two-parter. That we have to be reminded of. With a previously. As though we’re incapable of remembering what happened last week or intuiting it from the characters discussing the case.\n",

When people helped each other. I remember being a little kid and playing out on the street, going trick-or-treating. I don’t think anyone would allow their child to do that…”\n",

Some notable exceptions aside (RIP, Will Gardner), the courtroom is somewhere Alicia, Diane, Cary, and most of the other characters walk in and out of multiple times an episode. And it’s easy to forget that while Alicia’s sparring with Canning or Diane’s coming up with clever strategies to get her clients the most money possible, elsewhere in the same building, or even elsewhere in the same room, people we don’t get to learn much about are anxiously awaiting the decisions that will determine the rest of their lives.\n"
