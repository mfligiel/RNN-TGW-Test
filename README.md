# RNN - The Good Wife

This repository contains materials for a simple model (an RNN, yes, not a transformer), making simplified word generation for the good wife.  This version focuses mostly on using character level, rather than embedding level.

## Problem Statement

No problem statement here per se; rather the idea was to build a bot to amuse myself and friends.â€‹

## Data

Data was pulled from a blog, comprising reviews of every episode of the good wife, each over 1000 words.

## Structure of the repository

- Scripts Folder: This folder contains the python codes for models and all other relevant pieces
